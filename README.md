# RenderPlus

RenderPlus is a simple rendering engine using the OpenGL standard and C++. It was created to gain a deeper understanding of graphics programming, past the use of a game engine like Unity.

## Steps to Run

With Visual Studio 2019:
1. Select "Open a project or solution"
2. Open the solution file at `renderplus\OpenGL\Rendering Engine.sln`
3. Navigate to `src/main.cpp`
4. Click "Local Windows Debugger" or F5

## Functionality

RenderPlus implements various features of a rendering engine, including:
* Custom parser for GLSL shader code
* Vertex and fragment shaders
* Vertex buffer and index buffer abstraction
* Texture loading

## Status

***In development***\
Possible features:
* 3D rendering with external object importing
* Custom shaders
* Camera / input system
